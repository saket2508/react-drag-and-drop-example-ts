## React Drag and Drop Example

- An example showing you how you can use the react-beautiful-dnd library to add drag and drop functionality in your react app.

- Cards can reordered, dropped and dragged between lists.

- The UI designed here is similar to the storybook example shown in the library's [documentation](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).
